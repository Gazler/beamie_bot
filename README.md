beamie_bot
==========

Beamie is an IRC bot that can be often haning in the #elixir-lang channel on
irc.freenode.net.

It is based on [Chatty](https://github.com/alco/chatty) - a minimalistic IRC
client with support for user-defined hooks.


## Contributing

You can contribute by adding custom hooks or improving sentence pattern
recognition in existing hooks (e.g. `TriviaHook`). To test your changes, modify
the config to use a unique nickname and a test channel that doesn't have any
participants.
